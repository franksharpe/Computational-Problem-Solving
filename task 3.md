Comparison of Algorithms from Task 1 and Task 2
Complexity and Performance:
Task 1 Algorithm (Jiraya Industries):

Utilizes a list of dictionaries to manage orders.
Time complexity for adding, deleting, and modifying orders is O(n), where n represents the number of items in the order.
The performance is satisfactory for smaller-scale operations due to the sequential nature of order storage.
Task 2 Algorithm (Tanjiro Safety Products Ltd):

Also uses a list of dictionaries for order management.
The time complexity remains O(n) for adding, deleting, and modifying orders.
Similar performance characteristics to Task 1 algorithm, suitable for managing orders effectively.
Resource/Memory Usage:
Task 1 Algorithm:

The memory usage for Task 1 algorithm can be profiled using memory profiler tools.
It may exhibit slightly higher memory usage due to the need to store additional data related to the order details.
Task 2 Algorithm:

Memory usage profiling can also be performed for Task 2 algorithm.
Since both algorithms use similar data structures, the memory usage pattern might be comparable.
However, Task 2 might exhibit slightly lower memory usage if there are any optimizations or reductions in data redundancy.
Comparison:
Complexity and Performance: Both algorithms have similar time complexities and performance characteristics since they use the same data structures and follow similar approaches to order management. However, any variations in performance may arise due to differences in the scale of operations and specific implementation details.

Resource/Memory Usage: Without specific memory profiling data, it's challenging to pinpoint significant differences in memory usage between the two algorithms. Both algorithms are expected to consume memory in a comparable manner since they utilize similar data structures and operations.

Conclusion:
The algorithms from Task 1 and Task 2 demonstrate effective order management strategies suitable for different scenarios. While there may be minor variations in performance and resource usage, the fundamental approach remains consistent. Tanjiro Safety Products Ltd's algorithm builds upon the principles established in Jiraya Industries' algorithm, adapting them to suit its specific requirements without significant alterations in complexity or memory usage.
