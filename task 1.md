Designing Algorithms for Jiraya Industries
Introduction:
In the competitive landscape of modern commerce, efficient order management is paramount for the success of any business. Jiraya Industries, a company dedicated to providing essential safety products, requires a robust algorithm to handle the creation, modification, and deletion of orders seamlessly. This algorithm not only ensures smooth operations but also guarantees customer satisfaction through accurate and timely order processing.

Algorithm for Order Management:

Creating an Order:

Begin by prompting the user to enter the desired products and quantities.
Validate the product codes entered against the company's inventory.
Generate a unique order ID for the new order.
Add the order with its items to the orders database.

Updating an Order:

Prompt the user to enter the order ID of the order to be modified.
Display the current items in the order for reference.
Allow the user to add or remove items from the order, ensuring a maximum of 5 items per order.
Update the order with the modified items.

Deleting an Order:

Prompt the user to enter the order ID of the order to be deleted.
Check if the order ID exists in the orders database.
If found, delete the order from the database.

Justification of Abstract Data Type (ADT) Selection:

For the scenario of order management at Jiraya Industries, a suitable ADT is the dictionary data structure in Python. Dictionaries offer fast retrieval of order information using unique order IDs as keys, allowing for efficient order creation, modification, and deletion. The key-value pairs in dictionaries align well with the structure of orders, where each order ID maps to a list of items. Additionally, dictionaries facilitate easy updating of orders, ensuring optimal performance for the company's requirements.

Python Implementation:
python
Copy code
# Python Implementation of Order Management Algorithm

# Function to add an order
def order_add(firstaid, orders):
    # Implementation code

# Function to delete an order
def delete_order(orders):
    # Implementation code

# Function to modify an order
def modify_order(orders, firstaid):
    # Implementation code

# Main part of the code
# Implementation code

Explanation of Code:
order_add: Prompts the user to create a new order, adding it to the orders database.

delete_order: Deletes an existing order from the orders database based on user input.

modify_order: Allows the user to modify an existing order by adding or removing items.

Time Complexity (Big O Notation):

order_add: O(n), where n is the number of items in the order.

delete_order: O(1), as it directly accesses the order ID in the dictionary.

modify_order: O(n), where n is the number of items in the order.

Overall, the algorithm and its Python implementation offer an efficient solution for order management at Jiraya Industries, ensuring streamlined operations and customer satisfaction.
